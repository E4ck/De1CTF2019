This game is to examine CTFer's ability to extract the file system from the encrypted firmware. I don't want to just ask questions for the competition. I hope that the CTF competition will be closer to the real environment. so I used the firmware encryption method that exists in the real device.

There are two expected solutions to this game.

One is to write the script to decrypt the firmware by reversing the code of the function. The other is to use the encryption program provided by the firmware, you can find some useful information by searching the hint, which is why I used the DIR-850L instead of other models. 

I hope you can gain something.

Now, you have decrypted the firmware. Start hunting your router vulnerability !
